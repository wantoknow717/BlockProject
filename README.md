# BlockProject
This is a personal blog project created to train basic front-end skills and understand the real issues that front-end development may encounter in practice. It includes a blog homepage, several hard-coded article detail pages, and a back-end management page.
Currently, the basic setup of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has been completed, allowing basic login verification and the addition or deletion of articles in the back-end list.

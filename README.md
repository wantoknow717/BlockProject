# BlockProject
This personal blog project was created to train basic front-end skills, test self-learning achievements, and understand the practical issues that front-end development may encounter. 
Currently, the basic setup of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has been completed. It includes a blog homepage, several hard-coded article detail pages, and an admin page, capable of basic login verification and adding or deleting articles from the backend list.
The parts that will be added in the future include:
1. Optimization of the splash screen loading as features gradually increase.
2. Sending network requests via AJAX to interact with the backend.
3. Packaging the current code into Vue 3 to complete the basic component-based architecture.
4. Implementing subsequent performance optimizations and caching improvements.
